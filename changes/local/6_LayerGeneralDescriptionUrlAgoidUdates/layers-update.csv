TWPE is TWPE is the mass of a pollutant or chemical discharged that accounts for its relative toxicity. To convert pollutant loadings into TWPE, EPA multiplies the pollutant mass (in pounds) by its pollutant specific toxic weighting factor (TWF). Not all pollutants have a toxic weighting factor(for example, Total Suspended Solids), which means that these pollutants do not have a toxicity score (i.e., TWPE = 0).
