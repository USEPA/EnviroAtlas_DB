layerID,description
203,"This map layer portrays the percent of land within 45 meters of streams, rivers, and other hydrologically connected waterbodies within each subwatershed (12-digit HUC) that has natural land cover. Natural land cover includes forests, shrubs, grasslands, barren land, and wetlands; it excludes agriculture and developed land. For land use/land cover classifications, the conterminous US is based on the EnviroAtlas 2016 Cropland Data Layer-National Land Cover Database hybrid; Alaska is based on the 2016 National Land Cover Database; Hawaii is based on 2005-2011 NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) data; Puerto Rico is based on 2010 NOAA C-CAP data; and the US Virgin Islands is based on 2012 NOAA C-CAP data."
306,This map depicts the total kilometers of roads within a 45-meter stream buffer distance divided by the total kilometers of streams in the subwatershed (12-digit HUC) for 2021.
307,This map depicts the density of roads in km/km2 in the subwatershed (12-digit HUC) for 2021.
308,This map depicts the number of roads crossing streams in the subwatershed (12-digit HUC) for 2021.
309,This map depicts the density of stream-road crossings per stream km in the subwatershed (12-digit HUC) for 2021.
365,This map shows the percentage of land area in estimated floodplains in the subwatershed (12-digit HUC) classified as natural for 2019. NULL values indicate that no floodplain area was found within the hydrologic unit.
366,This map shows the percentage of land area in estimated floodplains in the subwatershed (12-digit HUC) classified as forest for 2019. NULL values indicate that no floodplain area was found within the hydrologic unit.
367,This map shows the percentage of land area in estimated floodplains in the subwatershed (12-digit HUC) classified as shrubland for 2019. NULL values indicate that no floodplain area was found within the hydrologic unit.
368,This map shows the percentage of land area in estimated floodplains in the subwatershed (12-digit HUC) classified as wetland for 2019. NULL values indicate that no floodplain area was found within the hydrologic unit.
369,This map shows the percentage of land area in estimated floodplains in the subwatershed (12-digit HUC) classified as developed for 2019. NULL values indicate that no floodplain area was found within the hydrologic unit.
370,This map shows the percentage of land area in estimated floodplains in the subwatershed (12-digit HUC) classified as agriculture for 2019. NULL values indicate that no floodplain area was found within the hydrologic unit.
371,This map shows the percentage of land area in estimated floodplains in the subwatershed (12-digit HUC) classified as agriculture - cropland for 2019. NULL values indicate that no floodplain area was found within the hydrologic unit.
386,This map shows the percentage of land area in estimated floodplains in the subwatershed (12-digit HUC) classified as rangeland for 2019. NULL values indicate that no floodplain area was found within the hydrologic unit.
443,This map estimates the percent of housing units built before 1950 by census tract. The values were calculated using data extracted from American Community Survey tables (2008-2012).
