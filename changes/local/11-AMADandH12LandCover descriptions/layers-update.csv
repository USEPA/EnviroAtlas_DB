21,"This map illustrates the percent of total land within each census block group that is covered by vegetation, or green space Green space may include trees, lawns and gardens, crop land, and forested wetlands."
101,"This map estimates the annual dry deposition of oxidized nitrogen within each subwatershed (12-digit HUC) in kilograms per hectare for 2017. Dry deposition occurs when particles or gases attach to surfaces such as dust or smoke and fall to the earth's surface."
102,"This map estimates the annual wet deposition of oxidized nitrogen within each subwatershed (12-digit HUC) in kilograms per hectare for 2017. Wet deposition occurs when rain, snow, or fog carry nitrogen to the earth’s surface."
103,"This map estimates the annual dry deposition of reduced nitrogen within each subwatershed (12-digit HUC) in kilograms per hectare for 2017. Dry deposition occurs when particles or gases attach to surfaces such as dust or smoke and fall to the earth's surface."
104,"This map estimates the annual wet deposition of reduced nitrogen within each subwatershed (12-digit HUC) in kilograms per hectare for 2017. Wet deposition occurs when rain, snow, or fog carry nitrogen to the earth’s surface."
105,"This map estimates the annual dry deposition of sulfur within each subwatershed (12-digit HUC) in kilograms per hectare for 2017. Dry deposition occurs when particles or gases attach to surfaces such as dust or smoke and fall to the earth's surface."106,"This map estimates the annual wet deposition of sulfur within each subwatershed (12-digit HUC) in kilograms per hectare for 2017. Wet deposition occurs when rain, snow, or fog carry sulfur to the earth’s surface."
181,"This map depicts the percent of land managed as cropland in each subwatershed (12-digit HUC). For cropland classifications, the conterminous US is based on the 2019 National Land Cover Database; Alaska is based on the 2016 National Land Cover Database; Hawaii is based on 2005-2011 NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) data; Puerto Rico is based on 2010 NOAA C-CAP data; and the US Virgin Islands is based on 2012 NOAA C-CAP data."
182,"This map estimates the amount of developed land within each subwatershed (12-digit HUC). For the purposes of this map, developed land cover includes a variety of development, such as single family homes, multifamily housing units, retail, commercial, industrial sites, and associated infrastructure. Developed land cover is not confined to city limits. For land use/land cover classifications, the conterminous US is based on the 2019 National Land Cover Database; Alaska is based on the 2016 National Land Cover Database; Hawaii is based on 2005-2011 NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) data; Puerto Rico is based on 2010 NOAA C-CAP data; and the US Virgin Islands is based on 2012 NOAA C-CAP data."
183,"This map depicts the percentage of land comprised of emergent herbaceous wetlands in each subwatershed (12-digit HUC). For land use/land cover classifications, the conterminous US is based on the 2019 National Land Cover Database; Alaska is based on the 2016 National Land Cover Database; Hawaii is based on 2005-2011 NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) data; Puerto Rico is based on 2010 NOAA C-CAP data; and the US Virgin Islands is based on 2012 NOAA C-CAP data."
184,"This map illustrates the percentage of total land within each subwatershed (12-digit HUC) that is covered by trees and forest. For land use/land cover classifications, the conterminous US is based on the 2019 National Land Cover Database; Alaska is based on the 2016 National Land Cover Database; Hawaii is based on 2005-2011 NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) data; Puerto Rico is based on 2010 NOAA C-CAP data; and the US Virgin Islands is based on 2012 NOAA C-CAP data."
185,"This map illustrates the percentage of total land within each subwatershed (12-digit HUC) that is covered by trees and forest or woody wetlands. For land use/land cover classifications, the conterminous US is based on the 2019 National Land Cover Database; Alaska is based on the 2016 National Land Cover Database; Hawaii is based on 2005-2011 NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) data; Puerto Rico is based on 2010 NOAA C-CAP data; and the US Virgin Islands is based on 2012 NOAA C-CAP data."
202,"This map illustrates the percent of total land within each subwatershed (12-digit HUC) that has natural land cover. Natural land cover includes forests, shrubs, grasslands, barren land, and wetlands; it excludes agriculture and impervious surfaces. For land use/land cover classifications, the conterminous US is based on the 2019 National Land Cover Database; Alaska is based on the 2016 National Land Cover Database; Hawaii is based on 2005-2011 NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) data; Puerto Rico is based on 2010 NOAA C-CAP data; and the US Virgin Islands is based on 2012 NOAA C-CAP data."
