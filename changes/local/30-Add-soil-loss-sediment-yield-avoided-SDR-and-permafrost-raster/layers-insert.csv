549,370,458,Sediment yield (tonnes per hectare) [grid] - Avoided due to natural vegetation,Avoided due to natural vegetation,This map depicts the average annual sediment yield to the nearest waterbody in metric tonnes per hectare that was avoided due to natural vegetation under 2011 land use/land cover.,,N140,https://enviroatlas.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/Rasters/SedimentYield_AvoidedDueToNaturalVeg/ImageServer,,"erosion, silt, turbidity, RUSLE",,,IMAGE,,,,https://enviroatlas.epa.gov/download/SYLD_avoided_MgHa_1e4.zip,CONUS,,,,,,
550,373,459,Sediment Delivery Ratio - Land cover (2011),Land cover (2011),This map depicts the average sediment delivery ratio per pixel under 2011 land use/land cover. The sediment delivery ratio is the percentage of soil eroding from a pixel that is transported to a downstream water body; it is based on the average for each 12-digit HUC. ,,N141,https://enviroatlas.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/Rasters/SedimentDeliveryRatio_ExistingLandCover/ImageServer,,"erosion, silt, turbidity, RUSLE",,,IMAGE,,,,https://enviroatlas.epa.gov/download/SDR_base_1e4.zip,CONUS,,,,,,
551,373,460,Sediment Delivery Ratio - Natural vegetation removed,Natural vegetation removed,This map depicts the average sediment delivery ratio per pixel under a 2011 land use/land cover scenario in which natural vegetation has been replaced with barren land. The sediment delivery ratio is the percentage of soil eroding from a pixel that is transported to a downstream water body; it is based on the average for each 12-digit HUC. ,,N142,https://enviroatlas.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/Rasters/SedimentDeliveryRatio_NaturalVegRemoved/ImageServer,,"erosion, silt, turbidity, RUSLE",,,IMAGE,,,,https://enviroatlas.epa.gov/download/SDR_scen_1e4.zip,CONUS,,,,,,
