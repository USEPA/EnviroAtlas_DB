373,1128,Soils,ESB,NATIONAL,Sediment Delivery Ratio,These maps depicts the average sediment delivery ratio per pixel under 2011 land use/land cover and a 2011 land use/land cover scenario in which natural land cover is replaced with barren land. The sediment delivery ratio is the percentage of soil eroding from a pixel that is transported to a downstream water body; it is based on the average for each 12-digit HUC. ,1,,1,,,1,1,,"erosion, silt, turbidity, RUSLE",grid
