105,Annual sulfur dry deposition (kg/ha),This map estimates the annual dry deposition of sulfur within each subwatershed (12-digit HUC) in kilograms per hectare for 2017. Dry deposition occurs when particles or gases attach to surfaces such as dust or smoke and fall to the earth's surface.
542,Soil loss (tonnes per hectare) [grid] - Existing land cover,This map depicts the average annual soil loss in metric tonnes per hectare under 2011 land use/land cover.
543,Soil loss (tonnes per hectare) [grid] - Natural vegetation removed,This map depicts the average annual soil loss in metric tonnes per hectare under a 2011 land use/land cover scenario in which natural vegetation has been replaced with barren land.
544,Sediment yield (tonnes per hectare) [grid] - Existing land cover,This map depicts the average annual sediment yield to waterbodies in metric tonnes per hectare under 2011 land use/land cover.
545,Sediment yield (tonnes per hectare) [grid] - Natural vegetation removed,This map depicts the average annual sediment yield to the nearest waterbody in metric tonnes per hectare under a 2011 land use/land cover scenario in which natural vegetation has been replaced with barren land.
